### Objective
The objective of the game is to correctly repeat a longer and longer sequence of movements.

1. Press the START button. Sonny wil give the first moevement. Repeat the movement by pressing the same body part.
2. Sonny will duplicate the first movement and add one. Repeat these two movements by pressing the same body parts.
3. Sonny will duplicate these first two movements and add one.
4. Continue playing as long as you can repeat each sequence of movements correctly.
5. If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, Sonny responds with 'woops!'. This means you've lost, and the sequence of movements ends.
